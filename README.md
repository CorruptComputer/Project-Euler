# Project Euler Solutions
I am using this as both an opportunity to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) and to improve my skills as a programmer. All the problems are taken directly from the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) site, however I will also save a copy of the problem in each solution folder as well. 

If you are interested in Project Euler, I would highly encourage you not to look at my answers, as it will spoil the fun and learning opportunities presented by them!
